\subsection{Analysis}
\label{subsec:Analysis}

The first step in creating a useful tool for the company is to define both functional and non-functional requirements, since they will shape the direction of the project from the very beginning. These requirements will be the outcome of the analysis process specified in this document.

First and foremost, the target audience and key stakeholders will be identified. Without this step, it would be difficult to narrow the focus to a specific group of people, which would make the requirements too broad and their validation much harder. Key stakeholders will mainly be used to validate the gathered requirements because they are the most interested in the project and can influence it the most. That being said, it is expected that stakeholder analysis should be completed in the first two days of Sprint 1.

Once the target audience is known, initial interviews with selected individuals will be conducted. The list of individuals for the interviews will be retrieved by contacting the key stakeholders or the HR department of the company. The aim of these interviews is to gain a better understanding of the bottlenecks and hurdles in the current process that this project is intended to address. The interviews will be structured, meaning that selected candidates will receive a list of questions in advance to ensure that all questions are fully answered. To better evaluate the responses, the interviews will be recorded (with the interviewee’s consent). After the initial interviews are analyzed, a list of requirements will be compiled and validated with the key stakeholders of the project. Interviews should be scheduled during the first week of Sprint 1 and conducted on a selected day in the second week. The following day should be reserved for gathering and reviewing the collected information.

While interviews will help identify the most obvious requirements, some may still be missed if interviewees are not fully prepared. To address this, an observation method will also be used, where two team members will observe the process that the product is meant to assist and take notes. Additional requirements identified this way will also be validated with key stakeholders. This should be done in parallel with the interview process to save time, meaning it will mirror the interview schedule.

Since there is an in-house application that has been tested but is not yet fully utilized, interviews with its developers will be conducted to clarify how the new product should integrate with the existing system. The conclusions from these interviews will mainly affect the functional requirements created earlier.

Based on the steps above, a list of functional and non-functional requirements will be created. This list will then be reviewed by the team and categorized according to the estimated size and complexity of each requirement. As a final step, the platform that will host these requirements will be chosen for better organization and progress tracking.

Finally, a paper prototype with wireframes will be created to represent the most important requirements from the requirements list. This paper prototype will serve as the final step of analysis, ensuring that the gathered functional and non-functional requirements are aligned with the client’s interests. 


 

\subsection{Available solutions}
\label{subsec:Available solutions}

It was mentioned by the SKC clients that an initial proof of concept had been already created toward the solution. Creative liberty has been given in terms of development with the exception being that the product needs to adhere to the current technology stack for the purpose of efficient integration.

It was discussed that access to the technology stack should be given to current developers of the team, after proper precautions have been taken toward data protection. The aforementioned technology stack includes a Microsoft Azure environment and API's through the programming language Python. Additionally, the product should leverage the Svelte software framework for reasons mentioned at the beginning of this section.

A general consensus was reached within the team in regards to available solutions. The initial idea was to create a node based system for visualizing the information gathered by SKC. The solution's main focus was to streamline data processing and improve visualization of data. Therefore, the proposed solution would enable users to visualize the relations between stacks of information which would in term improve the process of compiling data into the final document that would be received by government officials.

In order to acquire feedback from the clients a design was created in Figma, including a representation of the above mentioned node based system. In addition, the proposed solution included a list of all information contained in the database, coupled with a search functionality for the purpose of finding information quickly and effectively.

The proposed usage pipeline of the solution consisted of listing the readily available processed data and relating metadata on selection, displaying said data in a node, as well as all other nodes that would have some form of connection to the selected data.

\subsection{Advice}
\label{subsec:Advice}

\textbf{LO4:} You can give a suitable advice for solving a Software Engineering Design Problem. \\

Documentation is crucial for proper understanding and transfer of the product. The team will provide the client with complete and concise documentation through MkDocs. We will also create a separate advisory report that is centered around key aspects of the problem, as well as possible follow-up steps. \\

\textbf{Goal:} Our objective for this learning outcome is to provide clear, effective, well-founded advice for our client.\\
