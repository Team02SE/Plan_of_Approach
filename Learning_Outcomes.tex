\textbf{LO4:} You can give a suitable advice for solving a Software Engineering Design Problem. \\

Documentation is crucial for proper understanding and transfer of the product. The team will provide the client with complete and concise documentation through GitHub. We will also create a separate advisory report that is centered around key aspects of the problem, as well as possible follow-up steps. \\

\textbf{Goal:} Our objective for this learning outcome is to provide clear, effective, well-founded advice for our client.\\

\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
	\hline
	Specific & description  \\ 
	Measurable & description  \\ 
	Acceptable & description  \\
	Realistic & description \\
	Time-Bound & description \\
